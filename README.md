This "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game will be my first real javascript project. I will plan and write out my pseudocode before actually coding anything. I will also try to commit more frequently.  

The aim of this game is to pit user versus computer in a 5 round game of "rock, paper, scissors". Best 5 out of 9 wins.
